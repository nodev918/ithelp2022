# Node.js

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser.

> [!INFO] [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): a popular way to run Node.js
> It allows you to easily switch the Node.js version, and install new version to try and easily rollback if something breaks.
> It is also very useful to test your code with Node.js versions.

## An Example Node.js Application

In any case, when Node.js is installed you'll have access to the `node` executable program in the command line.

```javascript
const http = require('http')

const hostname = '127.0.0.1'
const port = 3000

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
    res.end('Hello World\n')
})

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`)
})
```

Node.js [standard library](https://nodejs.org/api/), including first-class support for networking.

- [`http` module](https://nodejs.dev/learn)
  - `createServer` creates a new HTTP server and returns it.

Whenever a new request is received, the `request` event is called, providing two objects:

1. a request (an `http.IncomingMessage` object) provides the request details. You can access the request headers and request data.
2. a response (an `http.ServerResponse` object) is used to return data to the caller.
